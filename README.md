Dodge the Blocks

Game #1 in my Godot learning series
This is a small arcade-style game where the player moves left and right at the bottom of the screen and tries to avoid falling blocks. The longer the player survives, the faster the blocks fall.

Controls:
Left / Right Arrow Keys   -   Move left and right
Enter or Space   –   Restart after Game Over
Esc   –   Quit the game

Features:
-Player movement with screen boundaries
-Randomly spawning falling obstacles
-Collision detection and game over state
-Score based on survival time
-Increasing difficulty over time
-High score tracking during a session
-On-screen UI for score and game over message

What I Learned:
-How to move characters using CharacterBody2D
-How to spawn scenes dynamically during gameplay
-How to detect and handle collisions correctly
-Why sprite and collision shapes must be aligned
-How to use a global GameManager to control game state
-How to update UI elements during gameplay
-How to structure a small but complete gameplay loop

Future Improvements:
-Save high score between game sessions
-Add sound effects and music
-Add visual effects when the player is hit
-Add a start menu or pause system

This project is part of a challenge to build multiple small games to practice core game development skills.
